#Koios-Badges
This is an application for maintaining and viewing koios badges(achievements). The application consists of 2 components: the creator tool and the student page.

#####Student tool
With the student tool a student can view there achievements from the blockchain minor. The student connects with metamask and the completed badges will appear. the student tool is only used for viewing as the user is not able to do anything with the viewed badges.

##### Creator tool
The creator tool is a place where a creator (teacher, coordinator etc) can create new badges. Only your own created badges will appear and only the creator can send those badges to other addresses.

### Research
The koios badges system work because there is a controlled party (the teachers, etc) who sends out badges. Therefore badges given to user by completing simple tasks has no real value. We intended the system to have users created badges where a student passes for example an exam or completed a project. So that the badges are given out by a teacher.

### Future
With the limited time we created a simple app where badges can be created and viewed by users. With this basic concept we have some more ideas that future project could build on:
* Badges to be shown in Koios environment
* Badges to be added to forum, so that users know who completed certain tasks and who doesnt
* Administrator tool who can control the creators (add creators/ remove creators)
* Store badge json data on ipfs
* Teacher(creator) permissions
* Remove badges
